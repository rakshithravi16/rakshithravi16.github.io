I recently graduated with a B.Tech (Hons) in Data Science and a Minor in Finance & Portfolio Management from MIT Manipal. I possess a solid grounding in data structures, algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning, along with practical experience tackling real-world data challenges.

I am always keen to delve into emerging technologies within the AI/ML field and take pleasure in addressing problems using a blend of data-driven insights and technical creativity. As I embark on my professional journey as a TDP Associate at Optum, I am looking forward to making a meaningful contribution and advancing my career as a data and AI specialist.
